# Shadow Agent + Business Insight System - Complete Architecture

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Created:** 2026-01-06
**Status:** Design Complete - Ready for Implementation

---

## 🎯 CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES

1. **Shadow Agent** = Execution health monitor that **holds, fixes, resumes** from failure point
2. **Data Issues** = Separate tracking (empty results, malformed data, missing fields)
3. **Business Insights** = Two types:
   - **Data Quality Insights** - Help users fix data problems
   - **Growth Insights** - Help users improve business operations
4. **No full reruns** - Resume from checkpoint, not step 1
5. **User decides** - Alert patterns: Stop workflow? Continue with fallback? Auto-retry?

---

## 🏗️ SYSTEM 1: SHADOW AGENT (Execution Health)

### Purpose
Monitor execution step-by-step, capture failures, propose fixes, enable resume from last good checkpoint.

### Key Behaviors

**When Step Fails:**
1. **Hold execution** (pause, don't fail entire workflow)
2. **Capture snapshot** (full context: inputs, outputs, state, dependencies)
3. **Classify error** (7 categories - see below)
4. **Determine if auto-fixable** or needs approval
5. **Propose repair** (fix code, change params, add fallback, alert user)
6. **Resume from checkpoint** (re-run failed step only)

**When Data Missing/Empty:**
1. **Detect scenario**:
   - Empty results (Gmail returns 0 emails)
   - Missing field (step1.data.invalid_field)
   - Null/undefined upstream data
2. **User decision required**: What should happen?
   - Stop workflow and alert user?
   - Continue with empty data?
   - Use fallback/default value?
   - Skip dependent steps?
3. **Store user preference** as behavior rule
4. **Apply deterministically** on future runs

### Error Classification (7 Categories)

```typescript
type FailureCategory =
  | 'execution_error'        // Plugin failed, API error, timeout
  | 'missing_step'           // Workflow missing required step
  | 'invalid_step_order'     // Dependencies not met
  | 'capability_mismatch'    // Plugin can't do requested action
  | 'logic_error'            // Conditional logic broken
  | 'data_shape_mismatch'    // Expected array, got object
  | 'data_unavailable';      // Empty results, missing fields
```

### Repair Strategies

| Error Type | Auto-Fix? | Repair Action |
|------------|-----------|---------------|
| **execution_error** (rate limit) | ✅ Yes | Retry with backoff |
| **execution_error** (auth) | ❌ No | Alert user to reconnect |
| **missing_step** | ✅ Yes | Insert missing step (with approval) |
| **invalid_step_order** | ✅ Yes | Reorder dependencies |
| **capability_mismatch** | ❌ No | Suggest alternative plugin |
| **logic_error** | ⚠️ Maybe | Fix condition (with approval) |
| **data_shape_mismatch** | ✅ Yes | Add transform step |
| **data_unavailable** | ❌ No | Ask user what to do |

### Checkpointing Strategy

**Current:** Checkpoint after every step (coarse-grained)
**Enhanced:** Multi-level checkpoints

```typescript
interface CheckpointLevel {
  step: StepCheckpoint;       // After each step (existing)
  batch: BatchCheckpoint;      // After parallel batch
  phase: PhaseCheckpoint;      // After major workflow section
  validation: ValidationPoint; // Before expensive operations
}
```

**Resume Logic:**
```
Workflow fails at Step 5
  ↓
Shadow Agent captures failure at Step 5 checkpoint
  ↓
Proposes fix (auto or approval)
  ↓
Resume from Step 5 (not Step 1)
  ↓
Steps 1-4 results preserved (metadata only, no data)
  ↓
Step 5 re-executes with fix
  ↓
Continue to Step 6+
```

### Execution Protection (Calibration Mode)

First 3-5 runs of new agent = "calibration mode"

**Protection mechanisms:**
- **Step limit**: Max 20 steps per run
- **Token budget**: Max 10k tokens per run
- **Early stop**: Pause on first failure (don't continue)
- **Cost cap**: Stop if cost exceeds $1
- **Checkpoint frequency**: After every step (not batched)

**After calibration:** Full production mode (no limits)

---

## 🏗️ SYSTEM 2: BUSINESS INSIGHT SYSTEM

### Purpose
Analyze executions to generate actionable insights that improve reliability, reduce cost, and grow business value.

### Two Insight Types

#### 1️⃣ **Data Quality Insights** (Fix Problems)

Answers:
- **What data is missing?** "Gmail search returned 0 emails - check search query"
- **What data is malformed?** "CRM returned array instead of object - add transform"
- **What fields don't exist?** "step1.data.contacts doesn't exist - available: step1.data.records"
- **What caused empty results?** "Airtable filter too strict - only 2/100 records matched"

Examples:
```
📊 Data Quality Insight
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Title: "Gmail search returning no results"
Type: data_unavailable
Severity: high

Issue:
Your "Expense Report Generator" ran successfully, but Gmail
found 0 emails matching "subject:expenses from:receipts@company.com".

Impact:
- No expense reports generated (0 items processed)
- Workflow completes but produces no business value
- Wastes 450 tokens per empty run

Recommendation:
1. Check if search query is too restrictive
2. Add fallback: If 0 results, search broader query
3. Alert you when 0 emails found

┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ [Apply Fix] [Ignore] [Edit] │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

#### 2️⃣ **Growth Insights** (Improve Business)

Answers:
- **What's working well?** "10/10 expense reports processed successfully"
- **What could be automated more?** "You manually approve 80% - consider auto-approval for <$50"
- **What's costing too much?** "Gmail fetch uses 2k tokens - enable caching to save 60%"
- **What patterns exist?** "Most expenses filed Mon-Wed - schedule agent for those days"
- **What risks exist?** "No fallback for Gmail failures - 1 API error stops entire workflow"

Examples:
```
💡 Growth Insight
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Title: "High manual approval rate"
Type: automation_opportunity
Severity: medium

Pattern Detected:
Your "Lead Qualification" agent requires manual approval
for 82% of leads (45/55 in last week).

Business Impact:
- Average 15min delay per approval
- 11.25 hours spent on approvals last week
- Potential leads lost due to slow response

Recommendation:
Auto-approve leads that match:
- Company size > 100 employees
- Industry in [SaaS, FinTech, Healthcare]
- Lead score > 70

Estimated savings:
- 9 hours/week saved
- 30% faster lead response time
- $180/week in time saved

### Insight Generation Flow

```
Execution Completes (or Partially Completes)
  ↓
InsightAnalyzer detects patterns:
  - Empty result workflows
  - Repeated failures
  - High manual approval rates
  - Token usage anomalies
  - Data structure mismatches
  ↓
ConfidenceCalculator determines insight_mode:
  - 1 run → observation
  - 2-3 runs → early_signals
  - 4-10 runs → emerging_patterns
  - 10+ runs → confirmed
  ↓
InsightGenerator translates to business language:
  - "You spent $X on Y" → Not "Step 3 used 2000 tokens"
  - "Consider automating Z" → Not "Add conditional step"
  - Language constraints applied based on confidence mode
  ↓
AdaptationEngine proposes behavior changes:
  - Fallback rules
  - Auto-retry policies
  - Caching strategies
  - Auto-approval thresholds
  ↓
User sees insight in dashboard/execution results
  ↓
User approves adaptation
  ↓
MemoryManager stores as behavior rule
  ↓
Next run applies memory deterministically
```

## 🎯 INSIGHT CONFIDENCE SYSTEM (CRITICAL)

### Core Principle (Non-Negotiable)

> **Insight confidence must scale with evidence.**
> With few runs, the system must NOT present trends, diagnoses, or strong recommendations.

Users will abandon the product if insights feel premature or fabricated.

### Confidence Modes

| Run Count | Mode | Allowed Insight |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| 1 run | **observation** | Describe what happened in the run |
| 2-3 runs | **early_signals** | Possible patterns, low confidence |
| 4-10 runs | **emerging_patterns** | Likely issues + cautious suggestions |
| 10+ runs | **confirmed** | Trends, risks, recommendations |

**Configuration:** Thresholds are configurable **globally per user** (stored in `profiles.insight_preferences`):
```json
{
  "early_signals_threshold": 2,
  "emerging_patterns_threshold": 4,
  "confirmed_threshold": 10
}
```

### Deterministic vs AI Responsibilities

**Deterministic Layer (no reasoning) produces:**
```typescript
interface ExecutionSummary {
  runs_analyzed: number;
  confidence_mode: 'observation' | 'early_signals' | 'emerging_patterns' | 'confirmed';

  // Factual data only
  step_success_rate: number[];
  fallback_usage_rate: number[];
  confidence_scores: number[];
  retry_counts: number[];
  resume_counts: number;
  manual_interventions: number;
  execution_durations_ms: number[];
}
```

Example deterministic input to AI:
```json
{
  "runs_analyzed": 2,
  "confidence_mode": "early_signals",
  "execution_summary": {
    "fallback_rate": [0.22, 0.25],
    "confidence_scores": [0.71, 0.69],
    "resumes": 1,
    "manual_interventions": 0
  }
}
```

**No client data. No interpretation. Just facts.**

**AI Insight Layer is responsible for:**
- Interpreting execution behavior
- Inferring possible business implications
- Communicating in business language
- Suggesting optional actions (when earned)

**AI is NOT allowed to:**
- Invent facts
- Claim trends without evidence
- Diagnose root causes with low sample size
- Suggest urgent or risky actions prematurely

### Language Constraints by Confidence Mode

**Mode: observation (1 run)**
```
Required language: "In this run...", "The workflow..."
Prohibited: trends, patterns, risks, recommendations
```

**Mode: early_signals (2-3 runs)**
```
Required language: "early", "initial", "possible", "worth monitoring"
Must state: "evidence is limited", "may reflect normal variability"
Prohibited: trends, root cause, urgency, strong recommendations
```

**Mode: emerging_patterns (4-10 runs)**
```
Allowed: "likely", "appears to be", "consider", "you might want to"
Still prohibited: definitive claims, urgent language
```

**Mode: confirmed (10+ runs)**
```
Allowed: trends, risks, strong recommendations, ROI claims
Full insight capability unlocked
```

### Example Outputs by Mode

**Observation (1 run):**
```
Run Summary

In this run, the workflow completed successfully in 12 seconds.
3 emails were processed and 2 CRM records were created.

No issues detected in this execution.
```

**Early Signals (2 runs):**
```
Early Observation

Across the first two runs, the automation required fallback
handling for some inputs.

This is common during early setup and may reflect normal
variability rather than a persistent issue.

No action is needed yet — I'll continue monitoring and
notify you if this becomes consistent.
```

**Emerging Patterns (6 runs):**
```
Possible Pattern Detected

Over the past 6 runs, the Gmail search step has returned
empty results 4 times (67%).

This might indicate:
• Search criteria may be too narrow
• Email patterns may have changed

You might want to review the search query or add a fallback
data source for when no emails are found.
```

**Confirmed (15 runs):**
```
Confirmed Trend: High Manual Intervention Rate

Over 15 runs, your "Lead Qualification" agent has required
manual approval 82% of the time (45/55 leads).

Business Impact:
• 11.25 hours spent on approvals last week
• Average 15-minute response delay per lead
• Estimated revenue at risk: $2,400/month

Recommendation:
Auto-approve leads matching these criteria:
• Company size > 100 employees
• Industry in [SaaS, FinTech, Healthcare]
• Lead score > 70

Projected savings: 9 hours/week ($180/week)

### Implementation: ConfidenceCalculator

```typescript
// lib/pilot/insight/ConfidenceCalculator.ts

interface UserInsightPreferences {
  early_signals_threshold: number;      // Default: 2
  emerging_patterns_threshold: number;  // Default: 4
  confirmed_threshold: number;          // Default: 10
}

type ConfidenceMode = 'observation' | 'early_signals' | 'emerging_patterns' | 'confirmed';

class ConfidenceCalculator {
  constructor(private userPreferences: UserInsightPreferences) {}

  calculateMode(runsAnalyzed: number): ConfidenceMode {
    const { early_signals_threshold, emerging_patterns_threshold, confirmed_threshold } = this.userPreferences;

    if (runsAnalyzed >= confirmed_threshold) {
      return 'confirmed';
    } else if (runsAnalyzed >= emerging_patterns_threshold) {
      return 'emerging_patterns';
    } else if (runsAnalyzed >= early_signals_threshold) {
      return 'early_signals';
    } else {
      return 'observation';
    }
  }

  getLanguageConstraints(mode: ConfidenceMode): LanguageConstraints {
    const constraints: Record<ConfidenceMode, LanguageConstraints> = {
      observation: {
        required_phrases: [],
        prohibited_phrases: ['trend', 'pattern', 'risk', 'recommend', 'should', 'must'],
        tone: 'neutral_factual',
        can_suggest_actions: false
      },
      early_signals: {
        required_phrases: ['early', 'initial', 'possible', 'may', 'might'],
        prohibited_phrases: ['trend', 'risk', 'urgent', 'critical', 'must'],
        tone: 'cautious_exploratory',
        can_suggest_actions: false
      },
      emerging_patterns: {
        required_phrases: ['appears', 'likely', 'consider', 'you might'],
        prohibited_phrases: ['definitely', 'must', 'urgent', 'critical'],
        tone: 'tentative_helpful',
        can_suggest_actions: true,
        action_prefix: 'You might want to'
      },
      confirmed: {
        required_phrases: [],
        prohibited_phrases: [],
        tone: 'confident_advisory',
        can_suggest_actions: true,
        action_prefix: 'Recommendation:'
      }
    };

    return constraints[mode];
  }
}

interface LanguageConstraints {
  required_phrases: string[];
  prohibited_phrases: string[];
  tone: string;
  can_suggest_actions: boolean;
  action_prefix?: string;
}
```

### Implementation: InsightGenerator Prompt

**Single prompt template with confidence mode injection:**

```typescript
// lib/pilot/insight/InsightGenerator.ts

function buildInsightPrompt(
  executionSummary: ExecutionSummary,
  confidenceMode: ConfidenceMode,
  constraints: LanguageConstraints
): string {
  return `
You are an AI insight generator for an automation platform.
Your role is to analyze execution data and provide business-meaningful insights.

## CRITICAL RULES

1. **Confidence Mode: ${confidenceMode}**
   - Runs analyzed: ${executionSummary.runs_analyzed}
   - You MUST match your confidence level to the evidence available

2. **Language Constraints:**
   - Required phrases to use: ${constraints.required_phrases.join(', ') || 'none'}
   - PROHIBITED phrases (never use): ${constraints.prohibited_phrases.join(', ') || 'none'}
   - Tone: ${constraints.tone}
   - Can suggest actions: ${constraints.can_suggest_actions}
   ${constraints.action_prefix ? `- Action prefix: "${constraints.action_prefix}"` : ''}

3. **You must NEVER:**
   - Invent facts not in the data
   - Claim trends with fewer than 10 runs
   - Diagnose root causes with fewer than 4 runs
   - Use urgent language with fewer than 10 runs
   - Suggest risky actions prematurely

4. **Business Language:**
   - Write for non-technical users
   - Focus on business impact, not technical details
   - Use time saved, cost saved, risk reduced

## EXECUTION DATA

${JSON.stringify(executionSummary, null, 2)}

## YOUR TASK

Generate a business insight following the confidence mode rules above.
Structure your response as:
- Title (short, business-focused)
- Description (what the data shows)
- Business Impact (only if confidence_mode is emerging_patterns or confirmed)
- Recommendation (only if can_suggest_actions is true)

Remember: The Insight Agent must earn the right to be confident.
Confidence increases only as run evidence accumulates.
`;
}
```

### Why This Matters (Design Rationale)

1. **Prevents "fake AI insight"** - No hallucinated trends from 2 runs
2. **Builds long-term user trust** - Insights feel earned, not guessed
3. **Avoids premature alarm** - Users don't panic over normal variability
4. **Scales across domains** - AI handles interpretation without brittle rules
5. **Deterministic control** - Confidence mode is calculated, not guessed

### Key Internal Rule

> **The Insight Agent must earn the right to be confident.**
> Confidence increases only as run evidence accumulates.

## 🚨 CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS

### Privacy & Data Security
1. **NEVER store client data** in shadow tables
   - ✅ Store: Metadata, counts, field names, types
   - ❌ Store: Email bodies, CRM records, message content, file contents
2. **Checkpoint data** = metadata only
   - Example: `{emails: {count: 5, fields: ['subject', 'from']}}` ✅
   - Example: `{emails: [{subject: "Re: Invoice", body: "..."}]}` ❌
3. **Behavior rules** = decision only, not data
   - Example: `{action: 'continue', alert: false}` ✅
   - Example: `{fallback_value: user_email@example.com}` ❌

### Performance
1. **Shadow Agent overhead** < 10ms per step
2. **Checkpoint storage** < 5ms per checkpoint
3. **Insight generation** runs async (post-execution)
4. **Memory lookup** < 5ms (cached in memory)

### User Experience
1. **No surprise behavior changes** - Always ask permission for intent-changing rules
2. **Clear language** - Business terms, not technical jargon
3. **One-click actions** - "Apply Recommendation" should be instant
4. **Predictable** - Same inputs + same rules = same outputs

### Data Retention Policies
1. **Failure Snapshots** - 30 days retention, then auto-deleted
2. **Execution Insights** - Retained indefinitely (can be manually dismissed)
3. **Behavior Rules** - No expiry unless explicitly set
4. **Repair Plans** - 30 days retention (follows snapshot lifecycle)

### Limits
1. **Behavior Rules** - No limit per agent (full count allowed)
2. **Active Insights** - Maximum 100 unviewed per agent (oldest auto-archived)
3. **Snapshot History** - Maximum 500 per agent within 30-day window

### Insight Lifecycle
```
new → viewed → applied/dismissed/snoozed
                      ↓
              snoozed (7 days) → reappears as new
```

**Snooze Option:** Dismissed insights can be "snoozed" instead, reappearing after 7 days if the pattern persists. This prevents alert fatigue while ensuring important issues resurface.

## 📚 APPENDICES

### A. Error Classification Examples

| Error Message | Category | Auto-Fix? | Action |
|---------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| "429 Too Many Requests" | execution_error | ✅ Yes | Retry with backoff |
| "401 Unauthorized" | execution_error | ❌ No | Alert user to reconnect |
| "Network timeout" | execution_error | ✅ Yes | Retry 3 times |
| "step1.data.contacts is undefined" | data_unavailable | ❌ No | Ask user what to do |
| "Expected array, got object" | data_shape_mismatch | ✅ Yes | Add transform step |
| "Condition field 'x' does not exist" | logic_error | ⚠️ Maybe | Fix condition (with approval) |
| "Plugin 'foo' does not support action 'bar'" | capability_mismatch | ❌ No | Suggest alternative |
| "Step depends on 'step99' which does not exist" | invalid_step_order | ✅ Yes | Reorder dependencies |
| "Workflow missing required step 'data_fetch'" | missing_step | ✅ Yes | Insert step (with approval) |

### B. Business Language Translation Examples

| Technical Message | Business Translation |
|-------------------|---------------------|
| "Step 3 used 2000 tokens" | "Gmail search cost $0.04 per run" |
| "Add conditional step with executeIf" | "Skip this step when no emails are found" |
| "Enable response caching" | "Save 60% by reusing recent results" |
| "Reduce parallel batch size" | "Process fewer items at once to avoid rate limits" |
| "Add error handler with fallback" | "Use backup data source if primary fails" |
| "Increase retry backoff multiplier" | "Wait longer between retry attempts" |

### C. Insight Type Catalog

**Data Quality Insights:**
- `data_unavailable` - Empty results, missing data
- `data_malformed` - Unexpected structure
- `data_missing_fields` - Required fields not present
- `data_type_mismatch` - Wrong data type
- `data_validation_failed` - Schema validation errors

**Growth Insights:**
- `automation_opportunity` - High manual approval rate
- `cost_optimization` - High token usage, caching opportunities
- `performance_degradation` - Slower than historical average
- `reliability_risk` - No fallback, single point of failure
- `scale_opportunity` - Could process more items
- `schedule_optimization` - Better timing for execution

### D. Behavior Rule Patterns

**Data Fallback:**
```typescript
{
  rule_type: 'data_fallback',
  trigger: {step_pattern: 'gmail_*', data_pattern: {field: 'emails', operator: 'empty'}},
  action: {type: 'fallback', params: {default_value: [], alert: true}}
}
```

**Auto-Retry:**
```typescript
{
  rule_type: 'auto_retry',
  trigger: {error_pattern: '429|503'},
  action: {type: 'retry', params: {max_attempts: 5, backoff_ms: 2000}}
}
```

**Skip on Empty:**
```typescript
{
  rule_type: 'skip_on_empty',
  trigger: {step_pattern: 'transform_*', data_pattern: {field: 'input', operator: 'empty'}},
  action: {type: 'skip', params: {reason: 'No data to transform'}}
}
```

**Auto-Approval:**
```typescript
{
  rule_type: 'auto_approval',
  trigger: {step_pattern: 'approval_*'},
  action: {type: 'auto_approve', params: {conditions: [{field: 'amount', operator: '<', value: 50}]}}
}
```
