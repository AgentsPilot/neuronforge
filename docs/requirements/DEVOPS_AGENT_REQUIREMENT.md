# Requirement: DevOps (DO) Agent

> **Last Updated**: 2026-10-30

**Created by:** BA
**Date:** 2026-10-30
**Status:** Draft

## Overview

The user does a lot of environment work: GitHub repo and org settings, Supabase projects, Vercel projects, and the Claude Code harness. No agent owns it today, and the know-how lives only in the user's private session memory. This requirement adds a **DevOps (DO)** agent that owns the configured state of everything outside application code. It also adds a set of skills that hold the environment knowledge, so the main session can use them as well as the agent. This is a team and tooling change. It adds no application code.

## 1. Background and Findings

| Finding | Consequence |
|---|---|
| The agents in `.claude/agents/` (TL, BA, Dev, SA, QA, RM, TS, peer-report-auditor) cover the build cycle and diagnostics. None of them lists the Supabase or Vercel MCP tools. | No agent can read environment state or check a change against it. |
| RM owns branches, commits, PRs and auto-merge. | Nobody owns repo **settings**: branch protection, merge queue, secret scanning, Actions. |
| Nobody owns Vercel config (env vars, crons, domains, deployments) or Supabase project config (migration application, advisors, auth settings, backups). | Post-merge environment steps, such as applying a migration or setting an env var, have no owner and no gate. |
| Environment know-how lives only in the user's private session memory. | The know-how is lost between sessions and cannot be reviewed. |

**Decided with the user. Not re-opened here.** Sections 3 to 5 record those decisions.

---

## 2. User Stories

- As the **user**, I want one agent to own environment and repo-settings work, so that it stops falling between RM and Dev.
- As the **user**, I want every production or irreversible change prepared for me as one exact step, then verified afterwards, so that I stay the only one who executes it.
- As the **TL**, I want a rule for when DO is triggered, so that a requirement or workplan with environment impact gets an environment change plan, and a post-merge environment step gets a gate.
- As the **main session**, I want the environment knowledge in skills, so that I can guide the user through dashboard work step by step. A background subagent cannot hold that dialogue.
- As a **reviewer (SA)**, I want risky environment plans to come to me before they are applied.

---

## 3. Decided Design

### 3.1 Role

DO owns the **configured state of everything outside app code, on every platform the system needs to operate** (user decision 2026-10-30: "any platform needed to operate the system needs to be included in the DevOps (DO) agent's scope").

| Area | DO owns |
|---|---|
| GitHub | Repo and org settings, branch protection, merge queue, secret scanning, Actions configuration |
| Vercel | Projects, env vars, crons, domains, deployments |
| Supabase | Projects, migration **application**, advisors, auth settings, backups |
| Claude Code harness | `.claude/settings*.json`, permissions, MCP servers, hooks, worktrees |
| Third-party platforms | Account, API key, webhook, test/live mode, domain and sender settings for every external service the code depends on: Stripe (incl. Connect), Resend and SMTP, Google Cloud (OAuth app, APIs, verification), LLM providers, QStash, AWS, WhatsApp and Slack apps, image and FX-rate providers, registrar and DNS |

The table is categories, not a closed list: a platform the code reads env vars for or imports an SDK of is in scope even when unlisted. DO holds tools only for Supabase and Vercel; for every other platform the user operates the dashboard, DO plans from the repo and verifies from the app side.

**Boundaries:**

| Agent | Owns | DO's relation |
|---|---|---|
| RM | Code reaching `main`: branch, commit, PR, auto-merge | DO makes sure environments and repo settings are correct. DO does not commit or open PRs for app work. |
| Dev | Application code, migration **files** | DO never writes application code. DO applies (or has the user apply) the migrations Dev wrote. |
| SA | Architecture and review | SA reviews DO's risky change plans. DO does not make architectural decisions. |

### 3.2 Skills carry the knowledge; the agent does bounded jobs

A subagent runs in the background and cannot hold the step-by-step dialogue that dashboard work needs. So:

- **Skills** hold the procedures and the gotchas. They must be written so the **main session** can follow them directly.
- **The agent** does bounded jobs only:
  - read-only audits and inventories
  - drift reports
  - change plans
  - post-change verification

### 3.3 Permission tiers

| Tier | Examples | Who acts |
|---|---|---|
| **Read** | Advisors, env var **names**, deploy logs, branch protection state, read-only pre-check and post-check SQL | DO, autonomously |
| **Reversible write** | A Preview-only env var, a ClickUp task status | DO plans → the user approves in chat → DO applies → DO verifies |
| **Production or irreversible** | Production DDL, key rotation, branch-protection changes, deleting a project or env var, production env vars | **The user executes.** DO prepares the exact step and verifies afterwards. |

Standing rules:
- DO may run read-only pre-check and post-check SQL itself. It **never applies DDL**.
- DO **never prints or decrypts secret values**.

### 3.4 Public-repo constraint (hard rule)

The repository is public. The agent file, every skill and this requirement must **never** contain:
- project refs or IDs (Supabase, Vercel, GitHub org or app IDs)
- where secrets are stored
- open security weaknesses

These facts are referred to by role, for example "the production Supabase project" or "the Preview environment". The concrete values live in untracked docs and the user's private memory.

### 3.5 Change protocol (core skill `env-change-protocol`)

This protocol comes from a real production outage. A key swap was "verified" against a sibling key, using a probe that could not fail, seconds before the deploy landed. Every environment change follows these steps:

1. **Snapshot the before-state.**
2. **Apply one change**, or have the user apply it.
3. **Wait** for the deploy or apply to report done before testing.
4. **Verify the exact value deployed.** Never verify a sibling created in the same sitting.
5. **Use a probe that fails when the change is wrong.** For example, for a service-role key: read an RLS-enabled table that has zero policies and rows in it. A read of a permissive table proves nothing. Prefer server-side timestamped evidence over "the page loaded".
6. **When a later step misbehaves, re-test the earlier steps.** Do not trust a recorded ✅.
7. **Record** what changed, where, and the evidence.
8. **Pace bulk actions on GitHub.** An account was once suspended by abuse detection after a high volume of PRs and pushes from parallel sessions.

### 3.6 Agent tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep | Read config, write change plans and drift reports |
| Bash | `gh`, and the `vercel` CLI once it is installed |
| Supabase MCP tools | Advisors, logs, read-only SQL, migration list |
| Vercel MCP tools | Projects, deployments, env var names, logs |
| ClickUp tools (optional) | Status sync of the DevOps task list |

The MCP tool names must be **listed explicitly** in the agent frontmatter. Two Supabase MCP servers are connected. **SA picks one** (see [Open Questions](#9-open-questions)).

### 3.7 Team integration

- Add DO to the CLAUDE.md **Agent Team** table: initials **DO**, triggered by **User or TL**.
- Add TL handshake rules:
  - A requirement or workplan with environment impact (env var, cron, migration to apply, repo setting, MCP or permission change) → **DO produces the environment change plan**.
  - A risky plan (production or irreversible tier) → **SA reviews it** before it is executed.
  - After a PR merges, any post-merge environment step (migration applied, env var set) is **DO's gate**. DO verifies it per the change protocol.
- Do **not** change the Ship drill numbering.

## 4. DO-1 Functional Requirements

**Branch:** `feature/devops-agent-do-1`

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| FR-1 | Create `.claude/agents/devops.md` with frontmatter (`name: devops`, a `description` stating role and triggers, an explicit `tools:` list per §3.6). |
| FR-2 | The agent body states: the role and owned areas (§3.1); the boundaries with RM, Dev and SA; the bounded jobs (§3.2); the permission tiers (§3.3); the public-repo rule (§3.4); a pointer to the `env-change-protocol` skill as mandatory for every change; and a **What You Must NOT Do** section. |
| FR-3 | The "What You Must NOT Do" section includes at least: never write application code; never apply DDL; never execute a production or irreversible change; never print or decrypt secret values; never write project refs, IDs, secret locations or open weaknesses into a tracked file; never commit or open PRs for app work (that is RM); never make architectural decisions (that is SA); never bulk-act on GitHub without pacing. |
| FR-4 | Create `.claude/skills/env-change-protocol/SKILL.md` with frontmatter `name` and `description` in the same format as the existing skills (for example `tenant-isolation-guard`). The description must make it fire on any environment or settings change: env var, cron, domain, deploy, migration application, auth setting, branch protection, repo setting, Actions, MCP server, permission or hook change. |
| FR-5 | The skill body holds the eight steps of §3.5, the permission tiers of §3.3, and a short **change record** template (what, where, before-state, evidence, who executed). It is written so the main session can follow it directly. |
| FR-6 | CLAUDE.md: add one row to the Agent Team table (`DevOps \| DO \| User or TL`). Optionally add one pointer line naming the `env-change-protocol` skill for environment changes. Rules and pointers only: no counts, statuses or dates. |
| FR-7 | `team-leader.md`: add the handshake rows of §3.7 to the Handshake Rules table, and add DO to the description line listing the agents TL delegates to. |
| FR-8 | `release-manager.md`: add one line stating the boundary. RM gets code to `main`; repo settings, environment config and post-merge environment steps belong to DO. |

## 5. Later Slices (DO-2 to DO-5)

Each later slice gets its own short scoping pass before build. Every skill follows the `env-change-protocol` skill and the public-repo rule.

### DO-2 `supabase-ops` skill ⬜

How to read and verify Supabase state: advisors, logs, migration list against repo migration files, auth settings, backups. How to prepare a migration for the user to apply (pre-check SQL, the exact apply step, post-check SQL) without DO applying DDL. Must carry the gotcha: **the Supabase SQL editor misreads the word "into" even inside string literals**, so pre-check and post-check SQL must avoid it.

### DO-3 `vercel-ops` skill ⬜

How to read and change Vercel state: projects, env vars by name and target (Production, Preview, Development), crons, domains, deployments and their logs. How to wait for a deploy to report done before testing, and how to find which deployment holds a given value. Must carry the gotchas: **the Vercel CLI is not installed yet** (MCP first, CLI only once installed), and **docs-only changes skip CI and the Vercel deploy via `.github/ci/non-deploying-change.sh` (exit 0 means skip)**, so a quick green on a docs PR is correct.

### DO-4 `github-ops` skill ⬜

How to read and plan changes to repo and org settings: branch protection, required checks, merge queue, auto-merge setting, secret scanning, Actions permissions and workflows. Branch-protection changes are in the user-executes tier. Must carry the gotchas: **auto-merge only when CI is the sole gate**; **pace bulk PR and push activity** (abuse-detection suspension); **never `git stash`** (the stash list is shared across parallel sessions and worktrees).

### DO-5 `claude-harness-ops` skill + `env-drift-audit` skill ⬜

`claude-harness-ops`: how to read and change `.claude/settings*.json`, permissions, MCP servers, hooks and worktrees safely. Must carry the gotcha: **worktrees share `node_modules` through a Windows junction, and `git worktree remove --force` deletes the shared contents. Unlink the junction first.**

`env-drift-audit`: a read-only audit that compares the expected state (repo files, recorded change records, untracked private inventory) with the live state across GitHub, Vercel, Supabase and the harness. It outputs a drift report by area and severity, with no secret values and no IDs in any tracked output.

### DO-6 `third-party-ops` skill ⬜

One skill, one section per platform the system needs to operate: Stripe (platform + Connect, test vs live keys, webhook endpoints and signing secrets, API version), Resend and SMTP (sending domain, DNS records for SPF/DKIM, sender addresses, API key per environment), Google Cloud (OAuth consent screen and verification, redirect URIs per environment, enabled APIs), LLM providers (keys and spend limits per environment), QStash, AWS (Textract), WhatsApp and Slack apps, image and FX-rate providers, registrar and DNS. For each: what must differ between environments, where the code reads it (env var names only), the dashboard step the user performs, and an app-side probe that fails when the setting is wrong. Scope it with an inventory pass first (env var prefixes and SDK imports), since the list is expected to grow. May split into smaller slices per platform group if the scoping pass shows it is large.

---

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security:** no secret values printed or decrypted. No project refs, IDs, secret locations or open weaknesses in any tracked file. Production and irreversible actions are executed by the user only.
- **Reviewability:** every DO change plan is one change per step, with before-state, exact action, and a probe that fails when the change is wrong.
- **Usability:** skills are usable by the main session without the agent.
- **CI cost:** DO-1 adds no CI job and no CI time.
- **Consistency:** the agent and skill files follow the format of the existing `.claude/agents/*.md` and `.claude/skills/*/SKILL.md` files.

---

## 7. Acceptance Criteria (DO-1)

- [ ] `.claude/agents/devops.md` exists with valid frontmatter (`name`, `description`, explicit `tools:` list including the chosen Supabase MCP and Vercel MCP tool names).
- [ ] The agent file states the role, the boundaries with RM, Dev and SA, the bounded jobs, the three permission tiers, the public-repo rule, and a "What You Must NOT Do" section covering FR-3.
- [ ] `.claude/skills/env-change-protocol/SKILL.md` exists with frontmatter `name` and `description` in the existing skills' format, and its description triggers on environment and settings changes (FR-4).
- [ ] The skill contains the eight protocol steps, the permission tiers, and a change-record template.
- [ ] CLAUDE.md Agent Team table has a DO row (initials DO, triggered by User or TL). The change adds no counts, statuses or dates, and the Ship drill numbering is unchanged.
- [ ] `team-leader.md` has the DO handshake rows (environment change plan, SA review of risky plans, post-merge environment gate).
- [ ] `release-manager.md` has the one-line RM/DO boundary note.
- [ ] **Grep check:** no committed file in the diff contains a Supabase project ref, a Vercel project or team ID, a GitHub app or installation ID, a secret value or key prefix, a secret storage location, or a description of an open weakness. QA runs a grep over the diff for ID-shaped strings and key prefixes, and reads the diff for the rest.
- [ ] The diff touches only `.claude/agents/devops.md`, `.claude/skills/env-change-protocol/SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/team-leader.md`, `.claude/agents/release-manager.md`, `.claude/agents/system-architect.md` and this requirement (SA finding 10).
- [ ] The finding-11 regex over the added lines of the diff returns zero hits, or each hit is explained in the QA report. The `tools:` line contains no `*`.
- [ ] Tool-list smoke test in a fresh session (SA finding 11): every listed MCP name resolves, no excluded tool is available, and the output contains no ID.
- [ ] The agent file names the forbidden Bash and `gh` families, states the verbatim-approval rule and the SQL rules R1 (a)–(d); the skill holds the order-against-deploy field, the rollback field and the no-secret probe rule; `team-leader.md` has all four finding-3 rows (SA finding 12).

---

## 8. Out of Scope / Future Roadmap

- The DO-2 to DO-5 skills (scoped in §5, built in later slices).
- Installing the Vercel CLI.
- Any actual environment change. DO-1 only defines the agent and the protocol.
- Moving the private environment inventory into the repo. It stays untracked by design (§3.4).
- Any application code change.

---

## 9. Open Questions

- [ ] **Q1: Which Supabase MCP server does DO use?** Two are connected. (raised by: BA | status: for SA)
  *Suggested resolution:* SA picks one and Dev lists its tool names explicitly in the frontmatter. Prefer the read-capable tools only (advisors, logs, list migrations, read-only SQL). Leave the apply-migration tool out of the list, so the "never applies DDL" rule is enforced by the tool list and not only by the prose.
- [ ] **Q2: Does the agent frontmatter accept a wildcard for MCP tools, or must each tool be named?** (raised by: BA | status: for SA)
  *Suggested resolution:* name each tool explicitly, as the user decided. Keep the Vercel list to read tools plus the env-var create/update tools needed for the reversible tier.
- [ ] **Q3: Include ClickUp tools in DO-1, or defer?** (raised by: BA | status: for SA)
  *Suggested resolution:* include only the read and status-update ClickUp tools, for syncing the DevOps task list. No create or delete tools.
- [ ] **Q4: Where does DO write change plans and change records?** (raised by: BA | status: for SA)
  *Suggested resolution:* the change plan goes in the workplan of the cycle that needs it, under an "Environment changes" section. Records that would name refs or IDs go only to the untracked private docs. The tracked record names environments by role.

## SA Review

**Reviewed by SA — 2026-10-30**
**Verdict: APPROVED WITH CHANGES.** The §3 design is sound and is not reopened. The changes below close gaps where the tool list or the handshakes would not actually enforce the agreed design. Dev builds DO-1 with findings 1–12 and rulings R1–R5 applied. No second SA requirement pass is needed. SA checks them at code review.

### Rulings on the open questions

**R1 (Q1): Supabase server = the Claude Code plugin server (`mcp__plugin_supabase_supabase__*`). Exclude the apply-migration and every other write tool.**
- Why the plugin server: its tool names are stable and readable, and it is the one the CLI session and subagents load. The claude.ai connector's server name is an opaque per-connection instance ID. It can change on reconnect, and writing it into a tracked file would breach §3.4. Do not name it anywhere in the repo.
- **Include (read only):** `list_projects`, `get_project`, `list_tables`, `list_extensions`, `list_migrations`, `get_advisors`, `get_logs`, `execute_sql`, `list_edge_functions`, `get_edge_function`, `list_branches`, `search_docs`.
- **Exclude:** `apply_migration`, `create_project`, `pause_project`, `restore_project`, `get_cost`, `confirm_cost`, `deploy_edge_function`, `create_branch`, `delete_branch`, `merge_branch`, `reset_branch`, `rebase_branch`, `generate_typescript_types` (Dev's domain), `get_publishable_keys` / `get_anon_key` (key material, see the no-secrets rule), and any tool not in the include list.
- **The list cannot fully enforce "never applies DDL".** `execute_sql` accepts any statement, DDL included. It stays in the list because pre-check and post-check SQL is a Read-tier job (§3.3). The agent body and the skill must therefore require all of the following:
  - (a) DO's SQL is SELECT-only.
  - (b) Each check is wrapped in a read-only transaction (`begin read only; … ; commit;`) as defence in depth. DO-2 confirms that this form works through the tool.
  - (c) Checks return counts, booleans or catalog facts, never customer rows or PII.
  - (d) DO never selects from `vault` or any decrypted-secrets view.
- **Future, not DO-1:** a separate read-only-mode Supabase connection for DO would turn (a) into real enforcement. It is a harness change, so log it for DO-5.
- **Names:** Dev confirms each name against the live server at build time. A name that does not exist is dropped. Nothing is added beyond this list without SA.

**R2 (Q2): name every tool explicitly. No wildcards.**
- Claude Code documents `mcp__server__*` for permission rules and command `allowed-tools`. It does not document wildcards in a subagent's `tools:` field.
- An unrecognised entry in `tools:` is dropped silently. An omitted `tools:` field inherits everything, MCP included.
- So: comma-separated exact names, and a smoke test that proves the names resolve (AC addition, finding 11).

**R3 (Q3): defer ClickUp. Leave it out of DO-1.**
- No DO-1 job (audit, drift report, change plan, verification) needs it.
- The update-task tool cannot be limited to the status field: it also edits names, descriptions and assignees. So it does not fit "status only".
- The DevOps list's identity is a private ID that would have to live outside the repo anyway.
- Revisit in DO-5 with a scoped proposal.
- The "ClickUp task status" example in §3.3 can stay as a tier illustration.

**R4 (Q4): BA's suggested resolution is accepted, with two additions.**
- (a) A change tied to a cycle goes in that cycle's workplan under `## Environment changes`, written by role only.
- (b) A standalone change (no cycle) goes only to the untracked private docs. No new tracked folder is created; that would be a new pattern for no gain.
- (c) Every plan and record follows the skill's template (finding 6).

**R5 (Vercel tool list): read tools only in DO-1. No Vercel write tool at all.**
- **Include, by category, exact names confirmed live by Dev:** list/get teams and projects; list/get deployments; deployment build logs and events; runtime logs and runtime errors; list env vars **by name and target only**; list domains and project domains (read); cron and project config reads; documentation search.
- **Why no writes:** the env-var create/update tools take the target environment as a parameter. The tool list therefore cannot tell "Preview only" (reversible) from "Production" (user executes). A list that allows one allows both.
- **Where reversible Vercel writes go:** they wait for DO-3. DO-3 may propose adding create/update env-var with a hard rule that the target is exactly `preview` (any call whose target includes `production` or `development` is out of bounds). That proposal needs SA re-review.
- **Always excluded:**
  - delete of anything: project, deployment, env var, domain
  - pause, promote, rollback and rolling-release controls, alias set/remove
  - domain buy/register/transfer, DNS and TLS writes, firewall and protection writes
  - Blob and Edge Config writes, sandbox tools, billing/usage purchase tools, integration installs
  - **any tool that returns decrypted env values**, and the `decrypt` flag on any list call

### Findings

1. **[§3.6 / FR-1] Bash is not restricted by the tool list.** With Bash and `gh`, DO can still change branch protection (`gh api -X PUT|PATCH|POST|DELETE`), set or delete secrets and variables (`gh secret set`, `gh variable set`), edit the repo (`gh repo edit`), open or merge PRs, and run `git commit/push/stash`.
   - The agent body must say that Bash is governed by prose. It must list these command families as forbidden, apart from the read forms (`gh api` GET, `gh secret list` names only, `gh pr view/list`, `gh run view/list`).
   - Once the Vercel CLI exists, the same applies to it. `vercel env pull` writes **decrypted** values to disk, so it is forbidden outright. Carry this into DO-3.
   — Priority: High
2. **[§3.3 / FR-2] The reversible tier needs a defined approval channel.** A background subagent cannot receive "approved" mid-run, and another agent's message is never user consent.
   - Rule: DO applies a reversible change only in an invocation whose brief quotes the user's approval message verbatim, for that exact plan.
   - Otherwise DO returns the plan and stops. The main session then either applies it itself with the user, or re-invokes DO with the quoted approval.
   — Priority: High
3. **[§3.7 / FR-7] Order against the deploy is missing.** "Post-merge environment step = DO's gate" is too late for a migration or env var that the merging code needs: the deploy lands before the step does.
   - The plan must state for each step whether it happens **before merge**, **after merge but before testing**, or **after deploy**. Additive schema the new code reads is applied before merge.
   - Handshake rows to add to `team-leader.md`:
     - *Dev submits a workplan with environment impact* → trigger DO to write `## Environment changes` in that workplan **before** the SA workplan review, so SA reviews both together.
     - *SA approves a plan containing a production or irreversible step* → that step is cleared for the user to execute, at its stated point.
     - *Any pre-merge environment step* → it is done and verified by DO before the user's diff approval goes to RM.
     - *RM confirms merge and the workplan has post-merge environment steps* → trigger DO to prepare the user's step and verify it per the protocol. The cycle is not closed until DO reports evidence.
   — Priority: High
4. **[FR-8] The RM edit needs a second line, not just one.**
   - `release-manager.md` currently says that when `--auto` fails with "Auto merge is not allowed", RM reports to TL. That line should also say the fix is a repo setting owned by DO.
   - Keep the boundary sentence too.
   - Do not move RM's merge-queue procedure; it is still RM's.
   — Priority: Medium
5. **[Boundary with SA] SA has no instructions for reviewing DO plans.**
   - Add a short `### Environment change plan review` subsection to `.claude/agents/system-architect.md`. It checks:
     - the tier is classified correctly
     - one change per step
     - the before-state snapshot
     - the probe fails when the change is wrong
     - the order against the deploy (finding 3)
     - a rollback step
     - no IDs or secret locations in tracked text
   - This adds one file to the DO-1 diff (see finding 10).
   — Priority: Medium
6. **[§3.5 / FR-5] Add a rollback step to the change-record template.** This is not a change to the agreed protocol. The fields are: what, where (by role), tier, before-state, exact action, **how to undo**, order against the deploy, probe and the evidence it produced, who executed, when. Production steps without a known undo must say so explicitly, so SA can weigh them. — Priority: Medium
7. **[§3.5 step 5] Probes must not need DO to hold a secret.**
   - Verifying a key means going through the deployed surface: an endpoint or job whose server-side, timestamped output proves which key it used.
   - It never means DO reading or using the key itself.
   - Say this in the skill, next to the RLS zero-policy example.
   — Priority: Medium
8. **[FR-6] CLAUDE.md change: compliant. Make the pointer required and give it a place.**
   - The Agent Team row `DevOps | DO | User or TL` contains no counts, statuses or dates. The Ship drill is untouched.
   - The pointer should be one row in **Common Gotchas**, on the same pattern as the `durable-queue-drain` row: *"Any environment or settings change (env var, cron, domain, migration apply, auth setting, repo setting, MCP/permission/hook) → Use the `env-change-protocol` skill"*.
   - Do not touch the Standard flow line, since DO is out-of-band like TS.
   — Priority: Low
9. **[FR-4] The skill description must also fire for the main session.**
   - The description should name the verbs a user actually types: "set/rotate/swap a key", "apply the migration", "add an env var", "change branch protection", "add an MCP server".
   - It should also say it is used **by the main session and by DO**.
   - It must not mention any concrete project, environment URL or ID.
   — Priority: Low
10. **[§7 AC, file list] Update the allowed-files criterion** to: `.claude/agents/devops.md`, `.claude/skills/env-change-protocol/SKILL.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/agents/team-leader.md`, `.claude/agents/release-manager.md`, `.claude/agents/system-architect.md`, and this requirement. Also add the DO-1 status update to §0. — Priority: Medium
11. **[§7 AC] Make the grep and the tool check executable.** Add these criteria:
    - **Grep (QA runs it over the added lines of the diff; zero hits required, or each hit explained in the QA report):**
      `grep -nE "[a-z]{20}|prj_|team_[A-Za-z0-9]{6,}|sb_(secret|publishable)_|sk_(live|test)_|eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{10,}|ghp_|github_pat_|\.supabase\.co|[0-9a-f]{8}-[0-9a-f]{4}-[0-9a-f]{4}-|vercel\.app"`.
      This also catches the claude.ai connector's instance ID. QA also reads the diff for secret locations and open weaknesses, which a regex cannot find.
    - **Tool-list smoke test.** This needs a fresh session, because agent files are loaded at session start.
      - Invoke `devops` with a read-only job ("list your available tools, then report the advisor count by severity for the production Supabase project, named by role, with no IDs").
      - Confirm that every listed MCP name resolved, and that no excluded tool (`apply_migration`, any Vercel delete/promote/env write) is available.
      - Confirm that the output contains no ID.
    - The `tools:` line contains no `*`.
    — Priority: Medium
12. **[§7 AC] Add criteria for findings 1–7.** The agent file:
    - names the forbidden Bash and `gh` command families (1)
    - states the approval-channel rule (2)
    - states the SQL rules from R1 (a)–(d)
    The skill holds:
    - the order-against-deploy field (3)
    - the rollback field (6)
    - the no-secret probe rule (7)
    `team-leader.md` has all four rows from finding 3. — Priority: Medium

### Public-repo check (§3.4) of this requirement

- Pass. The requirement names environments by role only.
- The finding-11 regex over this file returns zero hits.
- The incident references in §3.5 and §5 (key-swap outage, account suspension) are closed history, not open weaknesses.
- The untracked docs are mentioned only as existing, never by path.
- Existing tracked docs named in §10 are fine.
- This SA section deliberately does not record the claude.ai connector's server ID.

### Approval

[x] Requirement approved with the changes above. Proceed to branch `feature/devops-agent-do-1` and implementation. SA will check findings 1–12 and R1–R5 at code review.

---

## DO-1 implementation notes

**By Dev — 2026-10-30.** Config-only slice, so no separate workplan. Nothing committed.

### Files changed

| File | Action | What |
|---|---|---|
| `.claude/agents/devops.md` | New | Agent definition: frontmatter with an explicit tool list, role, boundaries, bounded jobs, tiers, approval channel, Supabase SQL rules, Vercel rules, Bash/`gh` allowed and forbidden families, plan locations, public-repo rule, report format, What You Must NOT Do |
| `.claude/skills/env-change-protocol/SKILL.md` | New | Tier classification + approval, order against merge/deploy, the eight steps (with the no-secret probe rule), read-only SQL rules, record location + public-repo rule, change-record template, final checklist |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Edited | Agent Team row `DevOps \| DO \| User or TL`; one Common Gotchas row pointing at the skill |
| `.claude/agents/team-leader.md` | Edited | DO in the description's delegate list; the four handshake rows of SA finding 3 |
| `.claude/agents/release-manager.md` | Edited | Boundary sentence under the role intro; the "Auto merge is not allowed" line now says the fix is a DO-owned repo setting |
| `.claude/agents/system-architect.md` | Edited | `### Environment change plan review` subsection in Phase 1 |

### Tool names (R1, R2, R5)

Each MCP name was checked against the plugin servers' deferred-tool lists recorded in this project's local session logs. No wildcard is used.

- **Supabase (plugin server):** all of R1's include list resolved **except `get_logs`, which does not exist** on the current server. Its log tool is now `query_logs` (a read-only log query). Dev listed `query_logs` in its place, as the same approved capability under a new name. **SA to confirm at code review**; if SA rules it out, delete that one entry.
- **Vercel:** `list_teams`, `get_team`, `list_projects`, `get_project`, `list_deployments`, `get_deployment`, `list_deployment_events` (build events and logs), `get_runtime_logs`, `get_runtime_errors`, `filter_project_envs` (env var names and targets), `list_domains`, `get_domain`, `get_domain_config`, `list_project_domains`, `get_project_domain`, `search_vercel_documentation`.
  - The server has no dedicated cron tool and no separate build-log tool. Crons are read from `vercel.json` in the repo and from `get_project`.
  - `filter_project_envs` has a deprecated `decrypt` parameter. The tool list cannot block it, so the agent body forbids passing it.
  - Excluded on purpose: `get_project_env` and `get_shared_env_var` (single-variable reads that can return the value), `get_deployment_file_contents`, and every create/edit/delete/promote/rollback/alias/DNS/firewall/Edge Config/sandbox/billing tool.
- No ClickUp tools (R3).

### Acceptance criteria

| Criterion | How it is met |
|---|---|
| Agent file with valid frontmatter and explicit tools | `devops.md` frontmatter: `name`, `description` (role + triggers), a comma-separated `tools:` line with no `*` |
| Role, boundaries, jobs, tiers, public-repo rule, Must-NOT list (FR-2, FR-3) | Sections What You Own, Boundaries, Your Jobs, Permission Tiers, Public-Repo Rule, What You Must NOT Do (every FR-3 item, plus the approval and Bash items) |
| Skill exists, triggers on environment changes (FR-4, finding 9) | Description names the user's verbs (set/rotate/swap a key, apply the migration, add an env var, change branch protection, add an MCP server) and says it is used by the main session and DO. No project, URL or ID |
| Eight steps, tiers, template (FR-5) | Skill §1 tiers, §3 eight steps, §6 template |
| CLAUDE.md DO row, no counts/statuses/dates, Ship drill unchanged | One Agent Team row, one Common Gotchas row. Ship drill and Standard flow untouched |
| TL handshake rows (finding 3) | All four rows added |
| RM boundary note (finding 4) | Boundary sentence + the auto-merge line routed to DO. Merge-queue procedure not moved |
| SA plan-review note (finding 5) | Seven checks in the new subsection |
| Finding 1 (Bash/`gh`) | Agent § Bash and `gh`: allowed read forms and a forbidden-family table, incl. `gh api` field flags (which imply POST) and `vercel env pull` |
| Finding 2 (approval channel) | Agent § Permission Tiers and skill §1 |
| R1 (a)–(d) SQL rules | Agent § Supabase table, and skill §4 |
| Findings 3, 6, 7 in the skill | Skill §2 + the `When` field (order); the `How to undo` field (rollback); step 5 third bullet (no-secret probe) |
| R4 plan locations | Agent § Where Plans and Records Go, skill §5 |
| Grep check (finding 11) | Run over the added lines of the diff and the two new files: zero hits |
| Allowed files (finding 10) | The diff touches only the six files above and this requirement |
| Tool-list smoke test (finding 11) | **Not run by Dev.** Agent files load at session start, so it needs a fresh session. QA runs it |

## SA Code Review — DO-1

**Reviewed by SA — 2026-10-30**
**Verdict: APPROVED WITH CHANGES.** R1–R5 and findings 1–12 are honoured. Two small prose additions to `devops.md` (C1, C2) are required before QA; no re-review needed, QA checks they are present.

### Ruling on `query_logs` (replaces `get_logs`)

Approved. It reads the project's log store and cannot change project state, so it is the same Read-tier capability R1 approved under its old name. Logs can carry request data (emails in auth logs, paths, IPs), so rule (c) applies to log queries too: DO reports counts and aggregates, never log lines that hold PII. This is covered by C2.

### Checked and honoured

- R1 include list (with `query_logs`), no excluded Supabase tool; plugin server only, no connector ID anywhere. R2 explicit names, no `*`. R3 no ClickUp. R4 plan locations (agent and skill §5). R5 Vercel read tools only; `decrypt` forbidden; value-returning single-var reads excluded.
- Finding 1 forbidden families incl. field flags and `vercel env pull`; 2 verbatim approval (agent + skill §1); 3 skill §2 + `When` field + all four TL rows; 4 both RM lines, merge-queue procedure not moved; 5 SA subsection with all seven checks; 6 `How to undo` incl. "No known undo"; 7 no-secret probe; 8 Gotchas row is a rule/pointer, Standard flow and Ship drill untouched; 9 description verbs + "main session and DO"; 10 §0 updated, §7 file list fixed by SA in this pass; 11/12 §7 criteria added by SA in this pass.
- Grep (finding 11 regex) over the diff's added lines and both new files: zero hits.
- Consistency: no contradiction with `release-manager.md`, `team-leader.md` or CLAUDE.md. The skill is self-contained and usable by the main session without the agent (tiers say "anyone following this skill"; approval = the user's own chat message).

### Code Review Comments

1. **C1** `devops.md` § Bash and `gh` — the allowed list is not stated as exhaustive, so commands outside both lists (`gh issue create|edit|close`, `gh label create`, `gh cache delete`, `gh repo sync|fork`, `gh extension install`, `git checkout <branch>`/`git switch`) are in neither. Add: "Anything not on the allowed list is forbidden." — Priority: Medium
2. **C2** `devops.md` § Tool Rules — Write/Edit are unrestricted, so "Your tool list has no write tools today" is not true for repo-file config: DO could edit `.claude/settings*.json` (its own permissions), `.github/`, `vercel.json` or migration files. Add a Write/Edit rule: DO writes only the `## Environment changes` section of a cycle workplan and the untracked private docs; in DO-1 it never edits `.claude/settings*.json`, `.github/**`, `vercel.json`, or `supabase/migrations/**` — a harness or repo-file change is planned and applied by the main session with the user. Also add the `query_logs` PII clause from the ruling above. — Priority: Medium

### Optimisation Suggestions

- `team-leader.md`: the generic "Dev submits workplan → trigger SA" row precedes the new env-impact row; consider a "(see next row if environment impact)" note so TL does not fire SA first. Non-blocking.

### Code Approved for QA: Yes, once C1 and C2 are applied (QA confirms both sentences exist, then runs the fresh-session smoke test).

### SA re-check — TL routing + scope

**Re-checked by SA — 2026-10-30. Verdict: APPROVED.**

- `devops.md`: C1 (allowed list exhaustive), C2 (Write/Edit scope) and the log-PII clause are present and correct. The Third-party row, scope rule and "Platforms without a tool" paragraph match §3.1 and DO-6; DO holds no third-party tools, so the user operates those dashboards.
- `team-leader.md`: the workflow (DO plan before SA workplan review; post-merge DO verify), the widened trigger, the handshake rows and § DevOps (DO) Routing agree with `devops.md` on bounded jobs, tiers, the verbatim-approval rule, standalone plans in untracked private docs, and the user executing production steps. No conflict with `release-manager.md`, CLAUDE.md or the Standing User Preferences (diff approval and auto-merge unchanged).
- SA fixed in this pass: the generic "Dev submits workplan" row now points to the DO row (closes the earlier optimisation note); the routing row for applying a reversible change now says the main session applies it while DO's platform tools are read-only (DO-1); `devops.md` "sandbox/live" aligned to "test/live".
- Public-repo check: no IDs, refs, key prefixes, secret locations or open weaknesses in the changed text.
- Non-blocking: §3.7 says a *requirement* with environment impact triggers DO; TL only wires the workplan stage. Acceptable for DO-1 (DO plans against the workplan); revisit if BA-stage planning is wanted.

## Change History

| Date | Change | Details |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-10-30 | Created | BA drafted the requirement from the design already decided with the user. DO-1 is specified in detail; DO-2 to DO-5 are scoped. Awaiting SA review. |
| 2026-10-30 | SA review | APPROVED WITH CHANGES. Rulings R1–R5 (plugin Supabase server, read tools only; explicit names; ClickUp deferred; plan locations; Vercel read-only in DO-1) and findings 1–12 (Bash/gh rules, approval channel, order against deploy, SA plan-review note, rollback field, executable AC). |
| 2026-10-30 | DO-1 code complete | Dev built the agent, the `env-change-protocol` skill and the CLAUDE.md, TL, RM and SA edits. Supabase `get_logs` no longer exists; `query_logs` listed in its place, pending SA confirmation. Uncommitted, awaiting SA code review and QA. |
| 2026-10-30 | SA code review | APPROVED WITH CHANGES. `query_logs` approved. C1 (Bash allowed list exhaustive) and C2 (Write/Edit scope + log PII) required in `devops.md`. SA fixed §7: file list now includes `system-architect.md`; finding 11/12 criteria added. |
| 2026-10-30 | QA + fixes + scope | QA passed (6 pass, smoke test deferred). C1/C2 and the log-PII clause applied to `devops.md`; ClickUp example replaced. User widened scope to every platform the system needs to operate: Third-party row in §3.1, `devops.md` and the skill; DO-6 `third-party-ops` added. |

## QA Report — DO-1

**QA — 2026-10-30.** Mode: full, config/docs only. Strategy: static checks (grep, frontmatter parse, path checks, reading the diff). Run in the DO-1 worktree on the uncommitted changes. QA edited nothing except this section.

| # | Check | Result | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Public-repo grep (finding 11 regex) | ✅ Pass | Over the added lines of `git diff -U0` and the two new files: 0 hits. Over this requirement: 1 hit, line 360, which is the regex quoting itself (expected). Extra greps: no 7+ digit numeric IDs (so no ClickUp or org IDs), no `cec9` connector ID, no 16+ char lowercase or hex runs that look like a project ref. The word `vault` appears only in the rule "never select from `vault`" (agent § Supabase (d) and Must-NOT; skill §4 (d)). It names the Supabase schema as forbidden, not where a secret is stored. Reading the diff found no secret location and no open weakness. |
| 2 | Files touched | ✅ Pass | `git status --short`: M on CLAUDE.md, release-manager.md, system-architect.md, team-leader.md; untracked: devops.md, `env-change-protocol/` (holds only SKILL.md), and this requirement. `git diff --stat`: 4 files, +24/−2. Nothing outside the allowed list from finding 10. |
| 3 | Frontmatter | ✅ Pass | Parsed with js-yaml from a scratch script outside the repo. devops.md keys are `name`, `description`, `tools`, and `name=devops` matches the file. SKILL.md keys are `name` and `description`, and `name=env-change-protocol` matches the folder. `tools` has 34 entries: 6 built-in tools, 12 Supabase plugin, 16 Vercel plugin. None is `*`. No excluded tool: no `apply_migration`, no create_/update_/delete_/edit_, no promote, rollback or assign_alias, no `get_project_env`, `get_shared_env_var` or `get_deployment_file_contents`, no ClickUp, no `mcp__cec9…`. |
| 4 | Tool-name resolution / load smoke test | ⚠️ Deferred | The main session resolved all 28 MCP names against the live tool list. The load smoke test from finding 11 is **deferred to the user / a fresh session**, because agent files load at session start. It has not failed. |
| 5 | CLAUDE.md rule (no counts, statuses, PR numbers, dates) | ✅ Pass | Two rows were added: `\| DevOps \| DO \| User or TL \|` and one Common Gotchas row pointing at the skill. Neither has a number, status, PR or date. The Ship drill and the Standard flow are unchanged. |
| 6 | Links and paths | ✅ Pass | Every referenced path exists in the worktree: `.claude/skills/env-change-protocol/SKILL.md`, `.claude/settings*.json` (matches settings.json and settings.local.json), `.github/`, `.github/workflows/`, `supabase/migrations/`, `vercel.json`, `docs/SUPABASE_CLIENTS.md`, `docs/VERCEL_ENV_SETUP.md` (both tracked), `docs/runbooks/`, `docs/workplans/`. Every in-page ToC anchor matches a heading. |
| 7 | Failure path, forbidden in the agent body | ✅ Pass | devops.md: DDL is forbidden at line 10, the (a) rule at 73, the database clients row at 102 and the Must-NOT at 129. Printing or decrypting secrets: lines 11, 80 (never pass `decrypt`), 100 and 132. `vercel env pull` "outright": line 101. `gh auth token`: line 97. `gh api` with field flags: lines 86 and 96. Reversible change only with the approval quoted verbatim in the brief: lines 59 and 131. |

**Edge case (nice to fix, not blocking):** the reversible-tier example in devops.md line 56 is "a ClickUp task status". ClickUp tools are deferred (R3), so the example names a capability DO does not have. A Preview-only env var on its own is enough.

**Final status:** [x] All checkable criteria pass. The only item left is the fresh-session tool-list smoke test (item 4), which is owed by the user / a fresh session. No bugs found.
