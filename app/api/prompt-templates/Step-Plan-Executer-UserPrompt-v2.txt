Convert this execution plan into a workflow with name, description, and steps.
The text below is a Phase 3 enhanced_prompt. Do NOT change intent, scope, or add new goals.
Your job is to translate it into deterministic executable steps.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Name: [Clear, short agent name - e.g., "LinkedIn HubSpot Sync Agent"]
Description: [1-2 sentences in simple language explaining what this agent does for the user]

Then the numbered steps:

${enhancedPrompt}

Remember:
- First line: "Name: [agent name]"
- Second line: "Description: [1-2 sentence summary]"
- Then numbered steps using "Do X using service.action" format
- Use 2-space indentation for nested steps
- If any step requires information that is not explicitly available from earlier steps (IDs, folder/sheet names, channel IDs, date ranges, templates, recipients, etc.), you MUST explicitly name it as a required runtime input (e.g., "using the selected Google Sheet ID").
- Do NOT assume defaults or invent identifiers/IDs.
- Each step that produces data MUST state what it outputs using a short stable name (e.g., "Outputs: filtered_leads", "Outputs: per_recipient_payloads").
- Later steps MUST reference these outputs (do not re-describe or recompute).
- For "for each ..." behavior: first create a step that outputs an array of per-item payloads; then add a step whose description explicitly says "(runtime loops over each item in <output_name>)".- Only use service.action values that exist in the provided services context. If a required capability cannot be mapped, include the step anyway and mark it clearly as "UNSUPPORTED: no available service.action", with a short reason.
- For each numbered step, start with: "Do ..." and end with "Outputs: ...".
